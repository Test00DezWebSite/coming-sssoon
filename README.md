The main focus behind the Coming Sssoon page was usability and customisation.

We covered a number of different uses for the page (standard website, application, video example and a restaurant custom page). Whatever your use is, we think you will find one that fits your needs.

The next step is getting the look you want to the page. We added custom filters (standard black, blue, green, orange, red) that give an edge to the page. We can't want to see what you choose and use! We adjusted the transparency of the filters so any image can look good. Go ahead, try and use your own! You'll see how great it looks with our design.
